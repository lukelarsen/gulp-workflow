##My Gulp Workflow
###Usage
The only files you need to use the gulp file are:
- package.json
- .bowerrc (if you use Bower)
- gulpfile.js

All the other files are for testing to see if the gulp file runs as intended.

1. Move the three requred files to your project.
2. Run npm install
3. Adjust any of the configuration variables you need in the gulpfile to fit your project
